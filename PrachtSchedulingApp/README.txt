For the Login page requirements:

Create a login form that has the ability to do the following:
⭐Determine a user’s location.
⭐Translate login and error control messages (e.g., “The username and password do not match.”) into English and one additional language.
⭐Verify the correct username and password.

This program looks at the regional format for Spanish (Mexico) and translates the login form/messages from English to Spanish.

For this requirement:
*Create a function that generates an alert whenever a user who has an appointment within 15 minutes logs in to their account.

I have added comments to my AddAppointment and EditAppointment code in case you are evaluating this project outside of the
business requirement's business hours. 

If you comment out the code that requires you to schedule an appointment within the required business hours,
you can either add or edit and appointment to your date / time (within 15 minutes) to test that function.

I figured I'd make that easy if you're grading this outside of Mon-Fri, 9am-5am EST time!
